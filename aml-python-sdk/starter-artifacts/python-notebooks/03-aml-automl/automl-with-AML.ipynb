The run is configured to try at most 5 iterations where no iteration can run longer that 2 minutes. \n\nAdditionally, the data will be automatically pre-processed in different ways as a part of the automated model training (as indicated by the `preprocess` attribute having a value of `True`). This is a very powerful feature of Auto ML as it tries many best practices approaches for you, and saves you a lot of time and effort in the process.\n\nThe goal of Auto ML in this case is to find the best models that result, as measure by the normalized root mean squared error metric (as indicated by the `primary_metric` attribute). The error is basically a measure of what the model predicts versus what was provided as the \"answer\" in the training data. In short, AutoML will try to get the error as low as possible when trying its combination of approaches.  \n\nThe local path to the script you created to retrieve the data is supplied to the AutoMLConfig, ensuring the file is made available to the remote cluster. The actual execution of this training will occur on the compute cluster you created previously. \n\nIn general, the AutoMLConfig is very flexible, allowing you to specify all of the following:\n- Task type (classification, regression, forecasting)\n- Number of algorithm iterations and maximum time per iteration\n- Accuracy metric to optimize\n- Algorithms to blacklist (skip)/whitelist (include)\n- Number of cross-validations\n- Compute targets\n- Training data\n\nRun the following cell to create the configuration."
